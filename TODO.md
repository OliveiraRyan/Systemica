# Features:

### Alarms:
- Have like different *folders* of alarms and/or alarms that can repeat for a certain time period
    - (e.g. Every 46th minute of every hour from 9am to 5pm)
- Make sure alarms can have CLEARLY DEFINED names/purposes
- Try to reinvent the snooze function
    - Something basic like write up a reason why OR instead of snoozing it's "delay alarm for X minutes/hours"

### Times Table:
  - Something like MS Teams scheduler UI where you can drag and drop zones very easily	

### Pomodoro:
  - Basically [https://pomofocus.io/] and [https://pomodor.app/timer]
  - Make it more obvious on which stage you're on (e.g. Working Stage #3) and how close you are to Long Break. Loops after long break is completed.
  - Unsure if useful to have a "task list" under the pomodoro timer
  - Make it easy to change/update the pomodoro timer on the fly
      - Keep the *actual time* also running and have a button to easily go back to *actual time*
          - Can call it *actual time* and *relative time*
  - Pause/resume is essential
  - GOOD SOUND DESIGN is important
  - Maybe have an icon go colour/gray or a small timer to indicate that the pomodoro is running
  - Have a "show overtime" toggle button
  - Separate toggles in settings to auto start pomodoros/break timers

### Stats screen:
  - Literally just something basic af
    - \# of hours/mins focused
    - Amount of "overtime" in both phases of pomodoro
    - \# of alarms successfully stopped
    - \# of alarms snoozed/delayed
    - \# of alarms currently deployed
    - \# of hours from times table blocked/free per week
  - If I want to be cool, I can query by start/end date for more granular stats	

## Cool features:
- Send notifications (phone link, 3rd party app, sms, email, idk, etc.) to phone/watch (mostly to watch)
- Probably Out of Scope though a rudimentary **note taking app/system** could also be implemented. Unsure if that's better suited for another project or application that already exists
