# Systemica

An all-in-one organizational tool I'm building in my free time. This app is designed for me, by me to keep track of all sorts of routine tasks and keep me on track.

I also want the app to look at least half-decent to incentivise me to actually use it.

Keep in mind that the below is constantly being worked on and currently none of it is fleshed out. All current progress is being tracked in the TODO.md file.

### Features:

- Alarms:
  - An extensive alarm system to annoyingly notify you of what you should be doing
- Times table:
  - Keep track of your weekly routines to more easily visualize your free time
- Pomodoro:
  - Cause why not? Using it helps a ton!
- Stats:
  - Some basic stats if you want to dig deeper into your own habits

#### Stretch goals:

- Send notifications directly to phone/smart watch
- Rudimentary not taking app/system
  - I feel like this could be really useful but would require a lot of work and research to be done right
